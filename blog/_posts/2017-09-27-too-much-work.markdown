I have been trying to force myself to post on '{{site.title}}' but I simply have too much random stuff to do. From a 2000-words English essay to programming assignments, all of the things are consuming too much time. Perhaps I am doing something wrong? Maybe I am just procrastinating too much? I feel like I am procrastinating about the same amount as last year but it's just a lot of work this time of this year. Weird. I also want to go to EduHack during this weekend but I don't know if I can go and finish all the work necessary. It feels like balancing an infinitely large tree that is ever-growing....
