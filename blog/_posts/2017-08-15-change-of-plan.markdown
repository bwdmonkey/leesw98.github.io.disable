I realized that I should use this blog to discuss my life plans and goals rather than using to solely discuss technical projects I do. I always enjoyed the idea of problem solving whether it would through video games, puzzles, or hypothetical questions. However, a thing about these interests of mine is that they are hypothetical. Simple as that. As I grow older, I have became more interested in real life problems, whether it be finance, politics, or ethics.

By all means, I still love gaming and still play games yet I tended to gravitate towards other interests now. In the past, I would think about how to program a game. Nowadays, I think about how to produce an algorithm that would look at long-term growth about certain stock shares. I'm still trying to work out where I'd scrape the news data (Google Trend maybe?) and how I'd utilize the data.

Also, I'm changing the blog's name to '{{site.title}}'.
