I have accepted a job offer. The role is Jr. Web Developer at Modern Advisor. Definitely not a famous company or anything but I accepted the offer because of its characteristics. It's a small company with around 10 employees overall including 2 developers. The CTO has previous experience of working in Amazon for a while. The small team hopefully will allow me to learn a lot. I shall see whether I was right at January next year.
