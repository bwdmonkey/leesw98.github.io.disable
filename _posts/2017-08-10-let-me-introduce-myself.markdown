This is gonna be the site for my blogs. So, who is me? My name is Seung Won Lee but I tend to go by my English unofficial name of Tom. I'm currently a Computer Science B.A. student at The University of British Columbia. I'd like to say that I'm a super genius who knows how to do everything on a computer but that would be a lie. I have a good background in web development as that's where I decided to pursue Computer Science at a higher level institution. I have started to dabble recently (< 6 months at this current time) in scripting languages like Python and mobile development in Android using Java.
